#OpenStreetMap
##Describe what the project is. Does it have a mission statement?

OpenStreetMap is an open source project that seeks to ...

“The OpenStreetMap Foundation is an international, not-for-profit, democratic organisation with the tasks of supporting the OSM project, running and protecting the OSM database, and making it available to all. The OSMF membership is open to all who want to support the project and participate in the OSMF’s democratic process.” -[OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Mission_Statement)

##Describe the history of the project -- when / how did it start? Has it grown?


##Who are the contributors to the project?
Contributors are primarily volunteers. You can be a certain tier of membership to be put on the contributors list in addition to other perks. 


##Describe the project's funding. Is it funded? What kinds of support does it get?
Funding comes from the use of their API, community membership, corporate membership, donations, conference registrations and sponsorships. A full breakdown of their finances of 2017 vs 2016 can be found [here](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/w/images/7/7d/Financial_Statement_2017.pdf). You do not need to be a member to contribute to their [GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap). 

##Describe the project's community. Are there separate developer / user communities? Where are the primary places they interact?
Community interaction is a little weird for this project. It's divided into working groups. They don't have their own group forum or other communications so they rely on physical meetups at specific conference locations or an email to the general working group account. The meetings are documented and available [online](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Working_Group_Minutes).

##Does the project have a Code of Conduct? What does it consist of? If it does not, why?
Their Code of Conduct was adapted from the Contributor Covenant. 

##Does the project have a license? Why was the license chosen?
The new license they chose is ODbL, which is the [Open Data Commons Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). The foundations did something interesting in that they switched to ODbL from Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 2.0 license in 2012 because of how the previous license handled data([more detailed description of the changes](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence_and_Legal_FAQ/Why_CC_BY-SA_is_Unsuitable)). Licensing changes require a 2/3 vote from the members of the community in order to pass the changes.

##Evaluate the project's approach to equity, diversity, and inclusion in its community. What's the difference between diversity, inclusion, and equity? by Meg Bolger.
They have some information available in different languages. Legally, they have to include French, Italian, and English. They always have one version of their important documents such as the Contributor terms in a Human readable summary.

##Is the project still active? Why or why not?
It's still very active. The recently published a change related to map tiling rendering in [September](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/09/05/new-render-server-usa/).
